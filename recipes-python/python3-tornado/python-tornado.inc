SUMMARY  = "Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server and tools that power FriendFeed."
DESCRIPTION = "Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed. \
By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long \
polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user."
